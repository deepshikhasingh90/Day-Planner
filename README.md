# Day-Planner

## Overview

For this project, I've created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
 This daily planner allows user to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.

### Build Width
1. Html
2. CSS
3. javascript

### Programme logic :

1. The user is asked to select the length of the password and the characters he needs in his password. 
2. I created arrays for Uppercase, Lowercase, Special Characters and Numbers.
3. I Also created an empty array chars[], and depending on the user's choice of character , the created arrays would be pushed into the empty array chars[].
4. I used Math.random to randomly select values from the chars[] array.
